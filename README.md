# DND Dice Roller

Four-digit seven-segment display used with two inputs to "roll" a 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 20 sided dice. 

In other words, a random number from 1 to the dice number will be displayed on the display.

## Purpose

Created for family DND nights.

Tired of the dice rolling off the table? Spend hours making a digital dice roller instead of seconds to get a box!
